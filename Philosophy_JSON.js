    Explanation: "AWARENESS is key to self defense, without it the ability to defend ourselves is wasted, ALERTNESS is a heightened state of awareness. Do you know the difference between aware and alert? Being aware and alert will allow you to AVOID or ANTICIPATE any situation before it is too late and gives you the opportunity to use the proper ACTION. The student through daily dedicated practice can trust their instinct and act with the correct response."
